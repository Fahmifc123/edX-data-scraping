# Data Scraping - edX Courses

Data scarping is a process of extracting data from websites using its HTML structure. In this project, I have extracted course details from the edX website.

Note:

1. In edX Courses Scraping - 1 notebook, course_details.head() is displaying different result in Price column than it actually displayed in Jupyter notebooks. The data in csv file is the correct representation.
